# Overview
This project takes PDF files as input, uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text for each input PDF, classifies the document into one of twenty article categories and summarises the text to an arbitrary number of sententences (by default 3), before composing the document title, classification, summary and original text into a text file which is emailed to the user.

# Data
Arbitrary PDF files can be placed into the [input folder](managed_folder:QZb3pfTL) for classfication and summarisation.
