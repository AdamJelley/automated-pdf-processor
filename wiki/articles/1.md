# Overview
This project takes PDF files as input, uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text for each input PDF, classifies the document into one of twenty article categories and summarises the text to an arbitrary number of sententences (by default 3 using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)), before composing the document title, classification, summary and original text into a text file which is emailed to the user.

# Data
Arbitrary PDF files can be placed into the [input folder](managed_folder:QZb3pfTL) for classfication and summarisation.

The document classification model was trained on the 20 newsgroups dataset ([documentation](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)) which is publicly available from sci-kit learn as described [here](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html#).

# Project Components

## OCR for Text Extraction

The PDFs are first converted to image files using pdf2image ([documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/)) [here](recipe:compute_HNEvJqgm). The OCR is then performed using Google's open-source Tesseract library ([documentation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#tesseract-ocr)) [here](recipe:compute_htEULTjD).

## Model for Document Classification

As described above, the model was trained on the 20 newsgroups dataset available from sci-kit learn [here](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html#). The model uses a multiclass logistic regression classifier built on top of a tf-idf transformer and achieves an AUC of 0.995. Full details of the model are available [here](saved_model:YFMrHeDD).

The model was trained using integer labels (0-19) for performance reasons; the textual labels represented by these integers are rejoined after model scoring using this [lookup table](dataset:target_names_prepared).

## Text Summarisation

The text summarisation was performed using Dataiku's Text Summarisation [plugin](recipe:compute_PDF_topics) ([documentation](https://www.dataiku.com/product/plugins/text-summarization/)). This plugin provides an interface for three popular text summarisation algorithms including [TextRank](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf), [KL-Sum](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N09-1041) and [LSA](http://www.kiv.zcu.cz/~jstein/publikace/isim2004.pdf). By default this project uses LSA to select 3 sentences to summarise the document, but this can be changed using the [plugin](recipe:compute_PDF_topics) UI.
